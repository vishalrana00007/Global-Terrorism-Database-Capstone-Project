# Global-Terrorism-Database-Capstone-Project 
This project involves an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), a comprehensive and open-source database documenting global terrorist attacks from 1970 to 2017. Housing over 180,000 incidents, GTD provides an in-depth insight into international terrorist activities spanning almost five decades. The management and maintenance of this database are overseen by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) located at the University of Maryland, United States. This project aims to perform a detailed analysis and visualization of this database to gain salient insights pertaining to global terrorist activities.

The original dataset contained 181,691 rows and 135 columns, but it underwent data wrangling to streamline it for visualization and analysis, resulting in a reduced dataset with 181,691 rows and 20 columns.These columns include information such as the year of the terrorist attack, the month and day of the attack, the country where the attack occurred, the region in the world where it took place, the type of attack, the targets, the number of casualties (both killed and wounded), details about the responsible terrorist groups, the weaponry used, the motive behind the attack, whether the attack was successful or not, and whether it was a suicidal or non-suicidal attack.

My responsibility involved comprehending and analyzing the dataset, employing Python libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation and aggregation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization to understand the data's behavior in relation to the target variable, and utilizing NumPy for computationally efficient operations

In each chart created, I provided a rationale for selecting that specific chart type, highlighted the insights derived from it, and elucidated the potential impact it could have on business-related activities. Ultimately, I concluded the project with key findings and implications.
